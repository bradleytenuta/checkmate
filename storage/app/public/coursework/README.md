Inside each coursework there is an items folder. This folder contains all the zip files of all the submitted coursework for that piece of coursework. The zip when uploaded are given whatever name. But they are renamed and saved as the courework item ID. These uploaded files must be zips.

Each coursework will also have a 'tests' folder. This is where the junit tests a professor makes will be stored. These are optional and are not required but below is the location they will be stored at.

The folder structure is: 

- 'coursework/{CourseworkId}/items/{CourseworkItemId}.zip'
- 'coursework/{CourseworkId}/tests/{TEST_NAME}.java'
